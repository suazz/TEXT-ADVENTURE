# TEXT-ADVENTURE
This is my first text Adventure script in Python 3.8

I started out small with just simple print() functions, then I added if elif loops and I also added a ask_user/user_name so the game could be more interactive.

I am still a noob but I am proud of what I have made, now I just need more complex projects...
